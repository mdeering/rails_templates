h1. Rails Application Templates

Nothing to special here.  GitHub is just the perfect place to up my templates up on for sharing and reference.

h2. TODO List

* TODO: Find out if we have access to the name of the application inside our template without having to rely on the ask function
* TODO: Find a decent resource or guide for rails templates and figure out how to include other templates or modules
* TODO: Add the config file setup for exception notification plugin
