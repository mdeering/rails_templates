h1. Rails Application Templates

Nothing to special here.  GitHub is just the perfect place to up my templates up on for sharing and reference.

h2. Notice

This does work as is but I'm just doing a checkpoint checkin in this working state before I go after a new approach I found through "Hector's Groundwork Repo":http://github.com/hectoregm/groundwork/tree/master

Just looking into the ground work repo to see if I want to fork and refactor or start poaching code from it to better absorb the approach. 

h2. TODO List
